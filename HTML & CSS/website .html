                     earring, a personal ornament worn pendent from the ear, 
                     usually suspended by means of a ring or 
                     hook passing through a pierced hole in the lobe of the ear or, 
                     in modern times, often by means of a screwed clip on the lobe. 
                     The impulse to decorate or 
                     to modify the appearance of the ear seems to be almost universal.<br><br>
                     Earrings have remained popular for more than 7000 years, 
                     and originated in ancient Asia.
                     Egyptians would once wear earrings to signify the fact they were wealthy or
                     of a higher class. However, in ancient Rome, earrings were worn only by slaves, 
                     and in ancient Greece by prostitutes.<br><br>
                     Ancient Sumerian women's earrings are the earliest earrings archaeologists have discovered—
                     they date from perhaps 2500 B.C.E. and are typically gold hoops. 
                     Earrings of twisted wire, beads, and pendants were popular in the Aegean, Crete,
                      and Cyprus.
